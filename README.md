# RISC-V-Single-Cycle-Processor
Design and implementation of a RISC-V Single-Cycle processor based on the RV32I base instruction set. Modeling of the RV32I building blocks was done using VHDL. RISC-V assembly and code generation tools were used to load a set of 32-bit RISC-V instructions into instruction memory and execute these instructions on the processor.
